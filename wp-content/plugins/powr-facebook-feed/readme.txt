== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to create a POWr Account? =
Yes, you need a POWr Account.  Your account allows you to create and save plugins, edit them in your live page, and use them on multiple different websites.

= How do I add Facebook Feed to a page or blog post? =
Create and save the plugin in your WP Dashboard.  Then copy and paste the unique shortcode into any page or post. You can continue editing the plugin on your live page, in your WP Dashboard, or by logging in to www.powr.io.

= How do I add Facebook Feed to a theme? =
In your WP Dashboard, select Appearance > Widgets from the left sidebar. Find Facebook Feed under Available Widgets and drag it into a sidebar or footer.  Then visit the live page to set up the plugin.

= Can I add more than one Facebook Feed? =
Yes, absolutely!  To clone an existing Facebook Feed, paste the exact same unique shortcode into another page or post.

You can then edit and save a new version, and paste the new unique shortcode into a page or post.
