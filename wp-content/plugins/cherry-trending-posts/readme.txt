Adds rating and views count for posts and custom post types.


== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to track and display the most popular posts of your WordPress website based on the number of views, rating and the number of comments; and thus increase its view-per-visitor rate.

The plugin comprises three main components:

* __Post Views Counter__ – displays the number of page views for each post;
* __Post Rating__ – displays the number of votes and the average rating using a visual five-star system;
* __Widget__ – shows the most popular posts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload cherry-trending-posts folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

And of course, you will find new 'Cherry Trending Posts' widget in 'Appearance - Widgets' menu in your WordPress admin panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use? =

It is not enough to install and activate the plugin to make it work properly. You also need to add 2 actions to the template.

1. `do_action( 'cherry_trend_posts_display_rating' )` / `do_action( 'cherry_trend_posts_return_rating' )` - display / return HTML for ratings
2. `do_action( 'cherry_trend_posts_display_views' )` / `do_action( 'cherry_trend_posts_return_views' )` - display / return HTML for post views counter

For example, in the twentysixteen template you need to add the actions to the __template-parts/content-single.php__ file. In your template the actions can be stored in a different file.
